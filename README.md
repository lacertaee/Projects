#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/oqIjG7_8ZBY>
#### Description:
    In this game you have to guess the capitals of countries. there are 3 levels: easy, intermediate and hard. you have 3 chances and you need 10 guesses to complete easy level and 5 guesses to complete intermediate and hard levels. First i created a function to determine if provided username is valid(less than 8 characters and more than 2 characters). after that i created start, intermediate_l and hard_l functions to play the game. then i created another function called continue_game, it just asks the person if they want to continue playing, if no program exits, if yes it continues. when i finished all this, i started testing it. created test_project.py which tests if there are bugs and etc. i downloaded only one library, cowsay and imported sys and random. i dont know if there needed to be more but i really like what i created and i know i learned many things that will be helpful and neccesary for me in future. thank you CS50P.
